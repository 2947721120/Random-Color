      <h3>Examples</h3>   
      <h4>Basic usage</h4>
      <p>Once you've included <a href="https://github.com/davidmerfield/RandomColor">randomColor.js</a> on your page, calling randomColor() will return a random, attractive color as a hex string.</p>
      <code>randomColor(); <span class="comment">// Returned '<span class="randomColor" hue="" format="hex"></span>'</span></code>
      <br />
      <h4>Multiple colors</h4>
      <p>Pass an object with a count paramater to retrieve an array of distinct, random colors.</p>
      <code>randomColor({count: 36}); <span class="comment">// Returned ['<span class="randomColor" hue="" format="hex"></span>', '<span class="randomColor" hue="" format="hex"></span>', ...]</span></code>
      <span class="output" hue="" count="36"></span>        

      <br />

      <h4>Similar colors</h4>
      <p>Specify a hue parameter to retrieve random colors with a similar hue.</p>
      <code>randomColor({hue: 'orange', count: 18});</code>
      <span class="output" hue="orange" count="18"></span>

      <br />

      <h4>Contrasting colors</h4>
      <p>Returns a color which contrasts with orange</p>
      <code>randomColor({hue: {contrasts: 'orange'}, count: 18});</code>
      <span class="output" hue="orange" contrasts="true" count="18" style="background: orange"></span>
      <br />

      <h3>Why does this exist?</h3>
      <p>Generating colors at random is very simple. There are lots of neat one-liners for producing a random hex code. Here's one from Paul Irish:</p>
      <code>'#'+Math.floor(Math.random()*16777215).toString(16);</code>
      <span class="output" hue="" ugly="true" count="36"></span>
      <br />
      <p>However, if we run this code a few times we naturally end up with lots of browns and greys and murky greens. So I wrote a little function which allows you to pick a random color from a subsection of the 24bit color space. By default this subsection includes only attractive, bright colors but you can specify different preferences.</p>

      <h4>How could I use this?</h4>
      <p>Random colors might be useful for data visualizations, generative art, video games or just making your UI slightly more interesting</p>

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>
      The goal of randomColor is to modify the set of colors from which we pick randomly in a useful manner.
    </p>
    <h4>1. Pick a hue</h4>
      <p>First we pick a hue value (<em>H</em>) at random. <em>H</em> corresponds to the angle on the surface of the HSV cylinder. </p>

      <p>By default, <em>H</em> is picked randomly between 0 and 360. If a hue preference is specified then the range of possible <em>H</em> values is restricted. For example, we'd classify orange hues as lying between an <em>H</em> value of 18 and 46.</p>

      <h4>2. Pick a luminosity</h4>

      <p>If you look at a representation of the HSV color space, there's roughly a region of attractive colors to the top right for each H value between 0 and 360. </p>

      <p>Pick lighter colors from the top left of this region. Pick darker colors from the lower right of this triangle.<p>

      <p>If 'dull' pick outside the attractive triangle</p>

      <p>The attractive triangle will vary in area, but since hue is picked randomly the distribution of colors should be even, though the distribution of luminosities will vary at different hues.</p>

      <p>I could pick a random color from the dictionary first, then a random hue within that hue range.</p>

      <p>This would normalize for different colors, since there are more red hues on the HSV spectrum than yellow hues. This is super cultural.</p>

      <p>Perceived luminance is hard to represent digitally. Colors are quite complicated cultural constructs Nevertheless it's useful to generate attractive colors.</p>

      <p>When generating multiple colors, try to make them distinct. </p>
